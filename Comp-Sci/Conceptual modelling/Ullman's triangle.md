The **Ullman Triangle** is a model used to explain the relationship between **data**, **models**, and **reality** (or the real world).

**[[Conceptual modeling]]** is positioned at the **model** point of the triangle. It abstracts and simplifies **reality**, focusing on representing only those aspects of the real world that are relevant to the system.
