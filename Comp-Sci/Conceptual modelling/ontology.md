An **ontology** is a formal way of organizing and defining knowledge about a particular domain. It describes the **entities** (things) in that domain, the **relationships** between those entities, and the **rules** or **properties** that apply to them. Essentially, it’s like a blueprint or map that helps computers and people understand the structure of a particular subject area and how the elements within it are connected.

For example, in a medical domain:

- **Entities**: Doctor, Patient, Treatment.
- **Relationships**: A doctor **treats** a patient, a patient **receives** treatment.


**Upper Ontology (also Foundational Ontology)**: Universal, general abstract ontologies that define domain- and application-independent concepts and relationships (e.g., Unified Foundational Ontology — UFO), which can be used to precisely capture and communicate about specific domains.

**Domain Ontologies**: Ontologies that describe a particular, specific domain (area) (e.g., oil extraction).

- Domain ontologies that have a key (general) significance for a particular industry are usually referred to as **Core Ontologies** or **Reference Ontologies** (e.g., Legal Core Ontology).

You can use upper ontology to create domain specific ontologies
