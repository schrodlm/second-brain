Conceptual modeling is typically a **high-level abstraction** of the system being studied. It focuses on defining **entities** (objects or components of interest), **attributes** (properties of those entities), **relationships** (how entities interact with each other), and **processes** (how entities change or interact over time). The model is not concerned with implementation details like data structures or algorithms, which come later in the design process.

Some common tools used for conceptual modeling are:

- **Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD)**: Used in database design to model relationships between entities (e.g., customers and orders).
- **Unified Modeling Language ([[UML]])**: Used in software engineering to visually represent different aspects of a system like class diagrams, sequence diagrams, etc.
- **Flowcharts**: To represent processes and workflows.
