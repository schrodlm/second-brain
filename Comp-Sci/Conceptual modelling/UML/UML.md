UML (Unified Modelling Language) is a general-purpose visual [[modeling-language]] that is intended to provide a standard way to visualize the design of a system.

UML provides a standard notation for many types of diagrams which can be roughly divided into three main groups:

1. behaviour diagrams
2. structure diagrams

## Structure diagrams
Structure diagrams represent the static aspects of a system. It emphasizes the things that **must be present** in the system. They are used extensively in documenting the [[software architecture]] of a software system.

It is further split into:
1. [[class diagram]]
2. [[component diagram]]
3. [[object diagram]]
- you can find the rest on the hierarchy figure

## Behaviour diagrams
Behvaiour diagram represent the dynamic aspect of the system. It emphasizes what must happen in a system. They are used extensively to describe the functionality of software systems.

It is further split into:
1. [[activity diagram]]
2. [[use case diagram]]
