**Modal logic** is a type of formal logic that extends classical logic by introducing _modalities_, which are expressions that qualify statements. The two most common modalities in modal logic are **necessity** and **possibility**:

- **Necessity** (denoted by ◻): A statement is necessarily true if it is true in all possible worlds.
- **Possibility** (denoted by ◇): A statement is possibly true if it is true in at least one possible world.

### Key concepts in modal logic:

1. **Possible Worlds**: Modal logic assumes that statements can be evaluated in different "worlds" or contexts. A world represents a complete way things could be.
2. **Accessibility Relation**: This is the relationship between different possible worlds. One world can "access" another world if there is some logical pathway between them, allowing modalities like necessity and possibility to be evaluated relative to different worlds.

### Variants of Modal Logic:

- **Temporal Logic**: A form of modal logic where the modalities refer to time, such as "always in the future" or "sometimes in the past."
- **Deontic Logic**: Concerned with obligation and permission, where ◻ means "obligatory" and ◇ means "permitted."
- **Epistemic Logic**: Deals with knowledge and belief, with ◻ meaning "known" or "believed" and ◇ meaning "possible according to knowledge/belief."

### Example:

If we have the proposition "P":

- ◻P means "P is necessarily true" (true in all possible worlds).
- ◇P means "P is possibly true" (true in at least one possible world).

Modal logic has applications in computer science (like verifying software properties), philosophy (analyzing metaphysical claims), and linguistics (understanding the semantics of statements).
