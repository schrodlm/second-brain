I have a weird niche. I adore posts from social media that are supposed to be funny, but if dissected and maybe thought about a little longer than appropriate, actually hide some kind of a deep philosophical message or a concept. The most recent one I saw and I really enjoyed was this one.

*BTW this post took me such a long time to find, because I didn't remember specific keywords from the post, just the general story. I found out that AI tools can be used as a really effective fuzzy web searchers. Really cool stuff ðŸ˜„*

This post is really interesting. A guy hates showering his whole life, because the first few seconds the water is always freezing. He has a girl over and she asks him a really simple question. "Why don't you wait for it to warm up?". He thinks about it and does not really have an answer.

That's it. A very simple story about a seemingly dumb thing to do. Yet I just couldn't get it out of my head for some time, and it always randomly pops up. It is so interesting to me. For the purpose of my not-so-empirical analysis, let's call this guy Pete.

Now Pete isn't a dumb guy, yet such a simple thing that could improve his life is just avoiding him. It is such an embedded concept for him that he doesn't consciously think about it anymore. He just keeps doing it, because he doesn't know anything else. He always hated showers; that is just how it was. This may be an artifact from his childhood, ingrained into him by his parents.

I couldn't find any coined term which would umbrella this situation. I wanted to call this phenomenon a "dogmatic habit", a behavior done without questioning it or considering alternatives. It implies the habit is inherited. I was happy with this for a while. After another while, I realized it missed the mark. The adjective "Dogmatic" implies inflexibility; easily discarding or changing this habit would not be possible. Yet, our Pete does change his ways after the idea is pointed out to him. Another thing is, even though in Pete's case it seems the habit is inherited, it does not have to always be this way, do not limit what you can generalize.

I was searching for a more appropriate adjective to use. I found that "an unexamined habit" is the array of words I feel best describes this phenomenon. It highlights that the habit has never been subjected to critical thought. It may or may not be improved when person is challenged to think about the habit critically; in that moment, it could become the dogmatic habit mentioned before.

I really like that the name also relates to the most famous quote of the OG philosopher, Socrates. He said: 

> The unexamined life is not worth living

which of course he meant in a much broader and more grandiose sense, but it can pretty much be applied here. Socrates believed that the ultimate purpose of being human is to seek wisdom and improve one's soul. One needs to critically think about our own life, since to not do so is to fail at being human. This is a little bit too intense for me, but I can get behind that statement.

The lesson I feel I got from my pondering and from the pondering of the great ponderers before me is that we all have our own "cold showers"â€”dozens of unexamined habits worth exploring, you may find a lot about yourself you didn't know and you may even improve your life, like Pete. In a grandiose way of philosophers and in the name of generalizing - question everything all the time, and in this questioning do not forget to question yourself.  To question is to think and to think is to live.
