I wanted to get more into writing about my projects and thought in general since I want to better my writing. My thesis was in English and I really felt it lacking in the fancy words and coherent writing department. I figured that one of the better ways to get better at writing was to write. I wanted to write something meaningful that would be fun and entertaining and I remembered I actually have a static Jekyll site (this one!)
