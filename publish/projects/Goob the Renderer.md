description: Learning project to grasp core ideas of graphical engines.

---
This is a OpenGL-like rendering engine project. It started off in my second year in my Bachelor's program. I didn't get very far although it produced some cool outputs. 

I have decided now, two years later. I will implement a much better and cool looking project with the final idea to have a possibility to implement extremely simple games inside a TGA image format.

The idea is to create a rendering engine (Goob2) and adittionaly an app that is able to render TGA images and allow framing. For example 24-per-second the image will be reloaded with new data.
