Problems:
	1. auto-summary
	2. unequal cost/metric load balancing

# Characteristics
## Unequal cost/metric load balancing

Really qucik reaction to 
fastest routing protocol  

# Problem you have to be aware of
## auto-summary

## Quick reaction to a change
EIGRP is the fastest routing protocol when converging (reacting to a change) 
How does it work?
	EIGRP a distance-vector protocol (no designated router to maintain topological table) - every router maintains it's own topological table

### What if there is not feasible sucessor?
