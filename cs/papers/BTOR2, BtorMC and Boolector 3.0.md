Paper: [BTOR2, BtorMC and Boolector 3.0](https://fmv.jku.at/papers/NiemetzPreinerWolfBiere-CAV18.pdf)
## Abstract 
It introduces a new word-level [[model checking format]] [[btor2]] that focuses on capturing models of hardware and **potentially software**. This format is supported by [[model checker]] [[BtorMC]] which is built on top of a [[SMT solver]] [[Boolector]].

Principles on which it is built are [[bit-level format]] [[AIGER]] and closely follows semantics of [[stm-lib]] logics of [[bit-vectors]].
