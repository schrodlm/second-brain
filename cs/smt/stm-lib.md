It is a language to express SMT problems, the idea was to have a language **common across solvers**.

SMT-LIB was first proposed in 2003, howewer it was revised to meet additional needs. In particular, a very important application of SMT solvers is to be used as a backend constraint solvers for [[software verification]].
